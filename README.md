# nuxt-netlify-lambda-starter

This is a basic starter project for a prerendered [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) + [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) frontend with a [Netlify lambda function](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) backend.

##### [You can view the deployed app here](https://nuxt-netlify-lambda-starter.netlify.com/)

The Vue app is prerendered for improved SEO - you can learn more about server-side rendering and prerendering with Vue [here](https://ssr.vuejs.org/#ssr-vs-prerendering).

**NOTE:** this project can only be deployed via Netlify with [continuous deployment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/) enabled.
